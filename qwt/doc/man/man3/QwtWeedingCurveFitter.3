.SH "Detailed Description"
.PP 
A curve fitter implementing Douglas and Peucker algorithm\&. 

The purpose of the Douglas and Peucker algorithm is that given a 'curve' composed of line segments to find a curve not too dissimilar but that has fewer points\&. The algorithm defines 'too dissimilar' based on the maximum distance (tolerance) between the original curve and the smoothed curve\&.
.PP
The runtime of the algorithm increases non linear ( worst case O( n*n ) ) and might be very slow for huge polygons\&. To avoid performance issues it might be useful to split the polygon ( \fBsetChunkSize()\fP ) and to run the algorithm for these smaller parts\&. The disadvantage of having no interpolation at the borders is for most use cases irrelevant\&.
.PP
The smoothed curve consists of a subset of the points that defined the original curve\&.
.PP
In opposite to \fBQwtSplineCurveFitter\fP the Douglas and Peucker algorithm reduces the number of points\&. By adjusting the tolerance parameter according to the axis scales \fBQwtSplineCurveFitter\fP can be used to implement different level of details to speed up painting of curves of many points\&.

Increasing the tolerance will reduce the number of the resulting points\&.
