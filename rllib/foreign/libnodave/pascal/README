To build the test programs with freepascal under LINUX, run the script linux.build.
To build the test programs with freepascal under Windows, adjust the path to your compiler in
the batch file buildwin.bat, then run it.
The functionlity of the test programs here in the Pascal section is NOT the same as of the
programs in the C-section bearing the same names. This is because I do my testing in C and
only ported the most basic stuff to Pascal.
unit tests contains some subroutines used by all tests.
