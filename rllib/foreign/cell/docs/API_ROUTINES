CIP/Ethernet Library for Linux (CELL)
ROUTINES API document
Copyright 2001 and beyond, Ron Gage - Saginaw, MI

This is a draft document that attempts to teach about the different routines
available in the CELL library.  It is probably not complete and could very 
well be full of errors.

extern void ioi ( _data_buffer *buff, _ioi_data *ioi1, _ioi_data *ioi2, 
		int debug);
Ioi takes the data from the ioi1 and ioi2 structures and puts that data
(with a length count in words) into the data_buffer *buff.  Any element of
the ioi structure that is set to a value of -1 is not coded into the buffer
(and not counted).  In the case of the tagname element of the ioi structure,
it should be set to NULL if not needed.  


extern void list_interfaces (_comm_header *comm, int debug);
List_interfaces is a routine that identifies the interfaces available on
the ControlLogix PLC.  It is included with the library for a matter of
completeness and is not actually used for anything.  List_interfaces is part
of the initial communications with the PLC and it is not known if it can be
omitted.


extern void list_services (_comm_header *comm, _services *services, 
		int debug);
List_services identifies the services available on the PLC.  Only one
service, communications, is currently expected to be seen.  This routine
will populate the services structure.


extern void readdata (_data_buffer *buff, _comm_header *comm, int debug);
Readdata will read the response data from the ControlLogix and put that data
into the provided data_buffer.  The command uses a standard read(x) command
and therefore will block until data is received.  There is no attempt to
validate the data as received.  Data_Buffer->overall_len is set to the total
length of the data received.  Data_Buffer is zero'ed out before the data is
received.


extern void senddata (_data_buffer *buff, _comm_header *comm, int debug);
Senddata will send out the data in the data_buffer to the ControlLogix.  It
uses a standard write(x) command and will send out data_buffer->overall_len
bytes of data.  There is no attempt to validate the data being sent.


extern void nop (_comm_header *comm, int debug);
NOP sends out a No-Operation command to the ControlLogix.  This command is
intended to be sent if there are long lapses in otherwise normal data
exchance sequences - kinda like a keep-alive command.


extern void register_session (_comm_header *comm, int debug);
Register_session is the command to obtain a session_ID from the ControlLogix
PLC.  This session_ID is used to uniquely identify the communications
session.


extern void unregister_session (_comm_header *comm, int debug);
Unregister_session is how you "correctly" close off communications with the
ControlLogix.  It is not required as the ControlLogix will also recognize
the closing of the listening socket on it's own.


extern void fill_header (_comm_header *comm, _encaps_header *head, int debug);
Fill_header is used to populate the session_id and context fields of the
encaps_header.  


extern void establish_connection (_comm_header *comm, _services *services, 
		int debug);
Establish_connection will connect you to the ControlLogix that you identify
in comm_header->hostname.  This identity can either be a domain name or an
ip address.  Establish_connection will open the file descriptor, set up the
socket for talking with the ControlLogix, send out the initial
communications commands (list_interfaces, register_session, etc...), and set
up all the requisite structures.


extern void attach (_comm_header *comm1, int debug);
Attach is the actual routine used by establish_connection to create and open
the communications socket to the ControlLogix.


extern void list_targets (_comm_header *comm, int debug);
List_targets is another housekeeping command sent out when communications is
established.  CELL does nothing with the data received back from this
command.  It is not known if this command can be omitted.


extern void sendRRdata ( unsigned short timeout, _comm_header *comm, 
		_encaps_header *head, _data_buffer *buff, int debug);
SendRRdata will establish the beginning of the data buffer for a command. 
In doing so, it does the following:  zero out encaps_header, zero out
data_buffer, put sendRRdata command in encaps_header->command, put required
0x00000000 at beginning of data_buffer, put required command timeout in
data_buffer and then return.


extern void cpf_data (short datatype, _data_buffer *cpf_data, 
		_data_buffer *buff, int debug);
Cpf_data will fill in the Common Packet Header data.  First, it encodes the
datatype of the CPH, then it encodes the length of the CPH data, then it
encodes the CPH data itself (if it is non-null).  CPF stands for Common
Packet Format, another name for CPH.


extern void cpf (short addrtype, _data_buffer *addrbuff, short datatype, 
		_data_buffer *databuff, _data_buffer *buff, int debug);
Cpf calls cpf_data twice, once with addrtype and addrbuff, and the second
time with datatype and databuff.


extern void get_backplane_data (_comm_header *comm, 
		_backplane_data *backplane, _rack *rack, int debug);
Get_backplane_data will query the backplane object on the ControlLogix rack 
and fill the backplane structure accordingly.


extern void unconnected_send (_data_buffer *buff, int debug);
Unconnected_send places the PDU_unconnected_send command (0x52) into the
data buffer.


extern void makepath (_path *path, _data_buffer *buff, int debug);
Makepath generates ControlLogix path data into the data_buffer.  The
required path length (in words) is also generated.


extern void settimeout (byte priority, byte timeout, _data_buffer *buff, 
		int debug);
Settimeout encodes the priority and timeout bytes into the unconnected
message.  Known working values for these are: priority = 0x06, timeout =
0x9a.


extern void get_device_data (_comm_header *comm, _path *path, 
		_identity *identity, int debug);
Get_device_data retrieves the details about a card in a particular slot in
the ControlLogix Chassis.  Path is used to establish which slot to query. 
Note that you can not query the communications card you are talking through
by using a slot number.  In this case, you do not set a path to get the card
details.  In older ControlLogix systems, you could specify the path for the
communications module and still get the data.

extern void get_port_data (_comm_header *comm, _path *path, _port *port, 
		int debug);
Get_port_data is another one of those commands that are used during the
establishing of communications.  In spite of the port structure being passed
to the routine, CELL does nothing with this data.  It is not known if this
routine can be omitted.


extern void who (_comm_header *comm, _rack *rack, int debug);
Who is a convenient routine that will query all cards in the ControlLogix
chassis and fill in the rack structure appropriately.


extern void get_object_list (_comm_header *comm, _path *path, 
		unsigned long base, _tag_data *tags, int debug);
Get_object_list will retrieve the list of object identifiers from the
ControlLogix PLC.  This list of objects is then populated into the tag_data
structure.  

When an object list is retrieved (and base == 0), the list will contain the
identifiers for programs and tags.  When an object list is retrieved (and
base != 0), then base is assumed to be the object ID for a particular
program and the returned list will be the object ID's for the tags for that
program.


extern void get_object_details (_comm_header *comm, _path *path, 
		_tag_detail *tag, int debug);
Get_object_details will retrieve the data type for the object in question
(pointed to by tag_detail), and will also return the tag name.  In the case
of tags, this routine will also get the size of the array (which will be 0
if no array is defined).


extern unsigned short getsize (_tag_detail *tag);
Getsize will return the data size of a tag in bytes.  Array sizes are
utilized in this calculation.


extern void read_object_value (_comm_header *comm, _path *path, 
		_tag_detail *tag, int debug);
Read_object_value will populate the data portion of the tag_detail.  It
populates all elements of an array if the element is an array.  This routine
can issue several actual read commands to the ControlLogix if need be -
reads are limited to 256 bytes per read.


extern void write_object_value (_comm_header *comm, _path *path, 
		_tag_detail *tag, int debug);
Write_object_value will send the values of the data portion of tag_detail
into the ControlLogix, overwriting those values within the ControlLogix. 
All elements of an array will be sent, even those you do not wish to change
so make sure the data is up to date before sending.
