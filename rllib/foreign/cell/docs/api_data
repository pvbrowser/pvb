CIP/Ethernet Library for Linux (CELL)
DATA structure API document
Copyright 2001 and beyond, Ron Gage - Saginaw, MI

This is a draft document that attempts to teach about the different data
structures used and utilized by the CELL library.  It is probably not
complete and could very well be full of errors.

* * DEBUG * *

The integer called 'debug' is used throughout the various routines of CELL. 
Valid values are 0-4.  Increasing the value of debug results in printing
more information about the program flow and/or data manipulation within
CELL.  

Debug information is printed to console via a standard printf function. 
Should you require debug messages routed to a different point (STDERR - for
example), then you will need to redefine the 'dprint' macro, located at the
beginning of lib/libcell.h

The various debug levels are as follows:
0 - NIL   	Print no debug info (default level)
1 - VALUES	Print values as they are discovered
2 - TRACE	Print entry and exit from various routines
3 - DATA	Print data as it is sent and received from the CL
4 - BUILD	Basically print everything, including the building of 
		Data packet information.
		
* * DEFINED DATA * *

The following are command destinations.  A destination is where you are
sending a message to within the device.  A device can have several
destinations, each of which does it's own thing.  Several of these
destinations are undocumented - as in not a part of the CIP spec.  The
undocumented destinations are AB specific.		

#define IDENTITY 0x01
#define ROUTER 0x02
#define CONNECTION 0x05
#define CONNECTION_MANAGER 0x06
#define REGISTER 0x07
#define BACKPLANE_DATA 0x66
#define OBJECT_DETAILS 0x68
#define OBJECT_PROP 0x6a
#define OBJECT_LIST 0x6b
#define STRUCT_LIST 0x6c
#define PORT_OBJECT 0xf4

These are the actual commands to be sent to the destinations mentioned
above.  How each command works (or what it does) is variable, based on what
'object' you are sending the command to.  Again, several of these are
undocumented, AB specific extensions to the CIP spec.

CPH stands for Common Packet Header.  The CPH is the beginning of the data
portion of the ethernet packet, usually following immediately after the
ethernet encapsulation header.  The CPH is used with the Send_RR_Data
command (0x6f) and the Send_Unit_Data command (0x70).

#define CPH_Null 0x00
#define CPH_Connection_based 0xa1
#define CPH_Sequenced_address 0x8002
#define CPH_Transport_PDU 0xb1
#define CPH_Unconnected_message 0xb2
#define CPH_Sockinfo_ot 0x8000
#define CPH_Sockinfo_to 0x8001

PDU stands for ...  These are the commands used to send unconnected
messages. 


#define PDU_Forward_Close 0x4e
#define PDU_Unconnected_Send 0x52
#define PDU_Forward_Open 0x54
#define PDU_GetConnectionData 0x56
#define PDU_SearchConnectionData 0x57
#define PDU_ExForwardOpen 0x59
#define PDU_GetConnectionOwner 0x5a

These are the actual Encapsulation commands.  These are ethernet specific. 
This is the first byte of data actually sent from the PC to the PLC.

* * STRUCTURES * *

typedef struct {
unsigned short type;
unsigned short length;
unsigned short version;
unsigned short flags;
byte name[16];
} _services;

Services is the list of features that the device you are talking to
contains.  In normal everyday use, the services will contain one item, type
0x100, name "Communications".  If the device you are talking to does not
support "Communications", then you can not communicate with it - a catch-22.


typedef struct {
unsigned long topbase;
unsigned long base;
unsigned long id;
unsigned short type;
unsigned long arraysize1;
unsigned long arraysize2;
unsigned long arraysize3;
unsigned short datalen;
byte *data;	
byte name[32];
} _tag_detail;

Tag_Detail gives you information about a particular tag.  Topbase, base, and
id are all used to identify the individual object within the PLC, type is
the data type (can either be the CIP standard type, or there are AB specific
extensions that do show up).  The arraysize values tell you how many
elements in each array segment exist.  Datalen tells you how much data is
available for this tag (length is in bytes).  The pointer to data is the
actual tag data (values).  Name is the human readable tag name.


typedef struct {
_tag_detail *tag[2048];
int count;
int reference;
} _tag_data;

Tag_Data is a holding container for all the tags for a particular element
(a program is an element, for this purpose).  Basically, an array of
pointers (tag[x]) to the actual tag data, and a count of how many actual tags
are in the container.  Reference is used to tell you the object ID that
these tags belong to.


typedef struct {
long class;
long instance;
long member;
long point;
long attribute;
byte *tagname;
} _ioi_data;

IOI_Data is the routing instrument in CIP.  IOI stands for Internal Object
Identifier.  The IOI is clearly defined in the CIP spec.  One thing that is
NOT clearly defined is that a single command can have several IOI segments
and that the segments can repeat.


typedef struct {
byte rx_bad_m;
byte err_threshold;
byte rx_bad_crc;
byte rx_bus_timeout;
byte tx_bad_crc;
byte tx_bus_timeout;
byte tx_retry;
byte status;
unsigned short address;
byte rev_major;
byte rev_minor;
unsigned long serial_number;
unsigned short rack_size;
} _backplane_data;

This is the structure of data available for the ControlLogix backplane. 
This structure is not documented.


typedef struct {
short number1;
byte number2;
byte slot;
short number3;
short number4;
} _port;

typedef struct {
short family;
unsigned short port;
unsigned long address;
byte zero[8];
} _sock;

Port and Sock are CIP defined structures.  CELL does not utilize them but
defines them for possible future use.


typedef struct {
unsigned short ID;
unsigned short type;
unsigned short product_code;
byte rev_lo;
byte rev_hi;
short status;
unsigned long serial;
byte namelen;
char name[32];
} _identity;

Identity is used to define the basics about a card within the ControlLogix
chassis.  ID indicates the manufacturer of the device, type gives a generic
indication of what the card does (i.e., generic input/output,
communications adaptor, processor, etc...), and product_code is a
manufacturer specific identifier for the device.  Serial is a device serial
number.  Name is the ascii representation of the card's name.



typedef struct {
int size;
int slot;
int cpulocation;
_identity *identity[32];
} _rack;

Rack is a container for the entire ControlLogix chassis.  Size is the size
of the chassis, slot is the slot number of the Communications card,
cpulocation is the slot number for the first found CPU in the rack, and the
array of identity structs gives you more specific data about each card in
the chassis.


typedef struct {
short number1;
short number2;
short len;
short number3;
short number4;
short number5;
unsigned short port;
unsigned long ip_addr;
short number6;
short number7;
short number8;
short number9;
char address[16];
} _interfaces;

Interfaces is an undocumented structure in the ControlLogix.  It identifies
the interface you are talking to the PLC on.  The fields beginning with
"number" are not known and appear to not be relevent.


typedef struct {
byte data[DATA_Buffer_Length];
unsigned short len;
unsigned short overall_len; 
} _data_buffer;

Data_Buffer is a container for all data that is transmitted and received
from CELL.  Of note here is the two length coding fields - len and
overall_len.  Len is the length of just the data portion of the packet (does
not include the Encapsulation header or the path), whereas overall_len is
the total length of everything.



typedef struct {
int device1;
int device2;
int device3;
int device4;
} _path;

Path is used to identify the route to take to get the the CPU you wish to
talk to.


typedef struct {
unsigned short command;
unsigned short len;
unsigned long handle;
unsigned long status;
byte context[8];
unsigned long options;
} _encaps_header;

Encaps_header is the Ethernet specific packet encapsulation header.  Command
is the ENCAPS_[command] as listed above.  Len is the length of the data
portion of the command.  Handle is the session ID as generated and reported
by the PLC you are talking to.  Status is the set to '0' for commands and
should be '0' on replies.  Context is an 8 byte field that is copied from
the command header to the reply header - it has no meaning in the
ControlLogix PLC.  Options are set to '0' for Ethernet communications.


typedef struct {
unsigned long session_id;
int file_handle;
byte *hostname;
byte context[8];
byte error;
} _comm_header;

Comm_Header is used to identify all relevent data used for communicating
with the ControlLogix.  Session_id is the session handle used in the
Encaps_header.  File_handle is the file handle returned by the OS for
reading/writing to the ethernet socket.  Hostname is the domain name (or IP
address) for the ControlLogix you are communicating with.  Context is the
context from the Encaps_header.  Error will be '0' unless an OS level error
occured during communications.

unsigned long ctl;
float sp;
float kp;
float ki;
float kd;
float bias;
float maxs;

float dvdb;
float max1;
float min1;
float tie;
float maxcv;
float mincv;
float mintie;
float maxtie;
float data[17];
} _PID ;

PID is the structure of data as returned from the ControlLogix for PID type
tags.


typedef struct {
byte heartbeat[3];
byte ctl;
long preset;
long accumulator;
} _timer;

typedef struct {
byte junk[3];
byte ctl;
long preset;
long accumulator;
} _counter;

Timer and Counter are the structures of data as returned from the
ControlLogix for these types of tags.
