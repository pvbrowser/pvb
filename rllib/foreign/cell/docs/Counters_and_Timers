How the data for Counters and Timers is arranged
(c) Copyright - 2001 and beyond - Ron Gage, Saginaw Michigan


In the ControlLogix PLC, counters and timers are special case structures in
that they are predefined within the ControlLogix and they are fixed in
defination.

Timers:

Byte heartbeat[3]
Byte status
long preset
long accumulator

Heartbeat appears to tie the timer to the system millisecond clock.  When
the timer is enabled, these three bytes will increment at a very fast rate. 
Writing data into these registers *may* cause a brief amount of timing
slipage.  It is unknown if writing zero's (or any other values) to these bytes
will cause any problems.  If this is a concern, then you should write your
data into a holding register in the ControlLogix and have the ControlLogix
move the data from that holding register to the timer register you are
concerned with.

Status encompasses the individual control bits of the timer:
ER - 0x02
OV - 0x04
LS - 0x08
FS - 0x10
DN - 0x20
TT - 0x40
EN - 0x80

By doing a logical "and" operation between the given values above and the
status value, you can determine if that particular bit is on or off.

Counters:

Byte junk[3]
Byte status
long preset
long accumulator

The first three bytes of the counter data appear to be benign - unlike with
the timer data.  The status bit is simular to the timer's status byte:

UN - 0x08
OV - 0x10
DN - 0x20
CD - 0x40
CU - 0x80
